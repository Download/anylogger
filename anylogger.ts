   * An object containing a mapping of level names to level values.
   *
   * To be compliant with the anylogger API, loggers should support at least
   * the log methods corresponding to the default levels specified here, but
   * they may define additional levels and they may choose to use different
   * numeric values for all the levels.
   *
   * The guarantees the Anylogger API makes are:
   * - there is a log method for each level listed in anylogger.levels
   * - the levels error, warn, info, log, debug and trace are always there
   * - each level corresponds to a numeric value
   *
   * Note that the Anylogger API explicitly does not guarantee that all levels
   * have distinct values or that the numeric values will follow any pattern
   * or have any specific order. For this reason it is best to think of levels
   * as separate log channels, possibly going to different output locations,
   * instead of thinking of them as having a specific order.
   *
   * Adapters can modify this object to include levels corresponding with
   * those available in the logging library the adapter is for. Adapters will
   * ensure to always include the default levels and to have a log method for
   * each level, so all code can rely on that contract.

   * based on the `name` of the logger and the arguments given in `args`.
   *
   * if there is more than one argument given and the first argument is a
   * string that corresponds to a log level, that level will be called.
   * Otherwise it defaults to calling the `log` method.

   * log('error')            // calls log.log('error')
   * log('info', 'message')  // calls log.info('message')
   * log('error', 'message') // calls log.error('message')
   * log('Hello', 'World!')  // calls log.log('Hello', 'World!')
   * ```
   *
   * Having this code in anylogger makes writing adapters easier, because
   * they only have to override `anylogger.ext` and add the logging methods
   * to the new logger.
