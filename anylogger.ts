   * - each level corresponds to a numeric value

   * as separate log channels, possibly going to different output locations,
   * instead of thinking of them as having a specific order.
   *
   * Adapters can modify this object to include levels corresponding with
   * those available in the logging library the adapter is for. Adapters will
   * ensure to always include the default levels and to have a log method for
   * each level, so all code can rely on that contract.
